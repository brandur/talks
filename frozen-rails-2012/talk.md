# Post-Rails? Composable Apps with a First-class API.

* Desired talk duration: 30 minutes

## Abstract

Rails is the best framework for building web apps in the world, but is there a way we can get even greater leverage of Rails' strengths while producing a more maintainable system? Brandur talks about lessons learnt while separating API from the web, and how this pattern can be reused elsewhere for the greater good:

* More manageable codebases and healthier developers
* Using Rails for what it's best at&mdash;building web apps
* Keeping designers happy by giving them well-constructed APIs and saving them from constant operational load
* Using ActiveModel to face back onto your own platform
* Building self-service APIs for customers, but which are also reused by any number of internal components
* Opening the gates for the rest of the software ecosystem&mdash;Backbone apps and iOS


## Notes

Brand new talk inspired by very recent developments and ideas that we've put (and are putting) into practice here at Heroku.
