# RubyConf Uruguay 2014 Proposal

## Title

The Story of a Thousand Services: How Ruby-based Apps With First-class APIs Underpin a Platform

## Abstract

This talk tells the story of how a Ruby app that did everything badly was broken down into a mesh of Ruby services, each of which did a few things well, and how a company that was growing up architecturally learnt how to turn this process into organizational leverage.

Along the way we'll extract fragments of the story and turn them into more broadly applicable lessons for anyone considering SOA (Service-oriented architecture):

* How smaller codebases can lead to happier developers and lend them a feeling of ownership that results in higher quality and better understood applications.
* When to SOA: SOA isn't always the right thing. How to identify the line where the logistical advantages outweigh the communication overhead.
* How slicing a service across the right boundary can occasionally result in the operator's ultimate dream: a nearly maintenance free app.
* How to establish consistency across API's inside an organization by defining and adopting convention and using declarative tools to make it more difficult to break from the pattern.
* Best practices for gaining visibility into how services are speaking to each other and debugging complex interactions when things go wrong.


## Notes to Organizers

I gave a much more naive version of this talk back in Finland in 2012:

It's safe to say that two years down the line, I'm not quite as much of an idealist, but have some better stories to tell.

## Bio

Brandur is a Canadian computer engineer working for Heroku in San Francisco. While his career started doing .NET work for big enterprise, he eventually found nirvana working with open-source languages like Ruby. Today he works on the Heroku platform API that empowers developers around the world, and acts as the nerve center for a distributed platform.
